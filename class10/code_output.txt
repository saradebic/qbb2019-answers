The most upregulated gene in the late differentiation stage is Nupr1. Adcy6 is also upregulated but not as significantly. 
Genes in the same kmeans cluster as Nupr1 are:

Genes that are differentially expressed between the two earliest and two latest stages are:
Adcy6
Nupr1
The role of Nupr1 is reported to be negative regulation of the cell cycle, and as such it inhibits the proliferation of differentiated cells. Cells, in general, as they differentiate lose their proliferative potential. Therefore, Nupr1 being upregulated in late differentiation stages of cells makes sense.
